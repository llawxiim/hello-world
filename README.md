# hello-world
between covid 19 and my recent divorce it is time for me to reboot my life, starting with learning how to code
2 years out of a failed marriage, 12 years behind on college, and now trapped in the house with nothing but my phone, my computer, and my will to better myself, so many times i have said "there should be an app for that" well now i'll be the guy making them
